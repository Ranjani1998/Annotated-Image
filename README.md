# Annotated-Image
## Aim:
Based on the given assignment details, the objective is to develop a solution
using image processing techniques to partially de-annotate an image given an
original image and a fully annotated image. The solution should be able to
identify and remove specific annotations from the fully annotated image while
preserving the underlying information of the original image. The partially de-
annotated image should not contain any unwanted annotations or distortions that
may affect its interpretation. The solution should be efficient, scalable, and able
to generalize to different types of images and annotations.
## Solution Approach:
1. Load the original image, fully annotated image, and partially annotated
image using a suitable image processing library like OpenCV.
2. Analyze the fully annotated image to identify the annotations that need to
be removed. Since the assumption is that there will be only two
annotations per image (a dog and a cat), we can consider techniques like
color-based segmentation, edge detection, or template matching to locate
and segment the annotations.
3. Apply the identified annotation removal technique to the fully annotated
image, ensuring that the annotation representing the cat is retained. This
step may involve masking, inpainting, or other image manipulation
techniques.
4. Save the resulting partially annotated image to the specified output path
using the `cv2.imwrite()` function.
